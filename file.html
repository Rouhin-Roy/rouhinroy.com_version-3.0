          Here is a sum that I find bliss in. It's one of myriad such 
          clandestine creations that have gone onnoticed.<br>
          Here OD = x mm.(where x ∈  I<sup>+</sup>)<br>
          x = 80[(e<sup>(ln(2)/3)</sup>) - e<sup>(ln(2)/-3)</sup>)(e<sup>(2/3)(ln(2))</sup>) + 1 + e<sup>(2/-3)(ln(2))</sup>)] + 1<br>
          Here, e is Euler's number, ln() means Natural Logarithm.<br>
          OE = y mm.(where y ∈  I<sup>+</sup>)<br>
          y = ((+√323(ab)<sup>2</sup> + (ab)<sup>2</sup>) + 9)/(a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>)<br>
          Here, (a and b) ∈ I<sup>+</sup><br>
          and (a - ((a + b)/2) = 0.5) || (b - ((b + a)/2)) = 0.5) = True.<br>
          Here, find<br>
          i> the area of square ABCD.<br>
          ii> the length of square ABCD upto 3 decimals.<br>
          iii> Let ∠ODE be x° - 1° [ Here x is given as in value of OD]
          therefore, find the angle subtended by AD at F.<br>

          then either you are Rouhin Roy or a human being that has attained<br>
          a higher level, who reigns on the pinnacle of glory, while this problem<br>
          is just the beggining, there are endless problems in the dark abyss<br>
          , on which there is a precipice where you remain elevated.<br>
